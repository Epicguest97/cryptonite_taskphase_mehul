**WEB EXPLOITATION**

PICOCTF

1\.Inspect Element

- Found the flag in the body tab of website when I inspected it.
- Anyways they should have kept the flag hidden in head tab then it would have related to Histiaeus as he hid messages on the head

2\.Intro To Burp

- Did a lightweight scan on website using burp(have professional version somehow)
- Didn’t find anything except one session cookie
- So registered while intercept was on 
- Forwarded it and did the same for otp form also
- Deleted otp= from request and got the flag

3\.Dont-use-client-side

- A verify function was given where flag was split in pieces of four
- Simple reconstruction- picoCTF{no\_clients\_plz\_b706c5}

4\.Where are The robots

- Obviously the creator would not want us to look at robots.txt
- Found / Disallow: /1bb4c.html
- Found the flag there

5\.SQL direct

- After downloading psql and connecting it, I had to google some basic commands
```bash
    (base) mehul@Mehuls-MacBook-Air ~ % psql -h saturn.picoctf.net -p 54826 -U postgres
