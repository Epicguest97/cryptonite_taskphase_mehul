The course "Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification" by Andrew Ng on Coursera provides a solid foundation in supervised machine learning. Here's a what I learned after completing this course.

1. # **Introduction To Machine Learning**
   1. <a name="1.1 what is machine learning?"></a>*What is Machine Learning?*
      0. #### **Definition:**
         Machine learning is defined as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Rather than hardcoding rules, the machine "learns" patterns from data to make decisions or predictions. The concept of learning in this context refers to improving performance on a specific task (e.g., prediction) based on experience (data).
      0. #### **Key Idea:**
         The key idea is that the model forms a hypothesis about the relationship between the input data and the desired output. With enough training data, the model can approximate this relationship, generalizing well to unseen data.

   1. <a name="1.2 types of machine learning"></a>*Types of Machine Learning*
      0. #### **Supervised Learning:**
         The course focuses on supervised learning, where the algorithm learns from labeled examples (i.e., input-output pairs). The system uses training data to predict an output (continuous or discrete) given an input. Supervised learning can be divided into two key areas:

         0. **Regression:** Predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices, temperature).
         0. **Classification:** Predicting discrete categories (e.g., cat vs. dog, spam vs. not spam).
      0. #### **Unsupervised Learning:**
         This type of machine learning works with data that doesn’t have labeled outputs. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns or structure in the data. Examples include clustering (grouping similar data points) and dimensionality reduction.
      0. #### **Reinforcement Learning:**
         Though not the main focus of the course, reinforcement learning is briefly introduced. In this learning paradigm, an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions (e.g., training a robot to walk).

   1. <a name="1.3 supervised learning explained"></a>*Supervised Learning Explained*
      0. #### **Input-Output Mapping:**
         Supervised learning involves teaching the model to map input features (such as the size of a house or number of rooms) to the output (house price). The dataset consists of pairs: the input (also called features or variables) and the output (often referred to as the target or label).
      0. #### **The Learning Process:**
         In supervised learning, the model uses the training data to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs. During this learning process, the algorithm minimizes an error metric (cost function) that quantifies the difference between its predictions and the actual target values in the training data. The goal is for the model to generalize well to unseen examples.
      0. #### **Feedback Loop:**
         As the model receives new data, it continuously updates its predictions, improving performance. For example, in an email spam classifier, the system will learn to classify emails as spam or not based on labeled examples, adjusting its decision boundary as it processes more data.

1. <a name="1.4 key concepts in supervised learning"></a>*Key Concepts in Supervised Learning*
   0. #### **Features and Labels:**
      Features (or predictors) are the input variables used to make predictions. These could be measurable aspects of data, like the number of bedrooms in a house. The label (or target) is the output or result you want to predict, such as the house price.
   0. #### **Model Training:**
      Training involves feeding the model data (features and corresponding labels) and allowing it to adjust its internal parameters (like weights in a linear model) to minimize the error between its predictions and the actual labels.
   0. #### **Generalization and Overfitting:**
      A model must balance being accurate on the training data and generalizing well to new, unseen data. If a model fits too well to the training data (overfitting), it might perform poorly on test data. Generalization refers to the model's ability to perform well on unseen examples, and the course stresses methods to prevent overfitting.

1. <a name="1.5 applications of supervised learning"></a>*Applications of Supervised Learning*
   0. #### **Practical Examples:**
      The course emphasizes the wide range of real-world applications for supervised learning. For example:

      0. **Medical Diagnosis:** Using patient data (symptoms, test results) to predict diseases.
      0. **Email Filtering:** Classifying emails as spam or not spam.
      0. **Speech Recognition:** Translating spoken language into text.
      0. **Self-Driving Cars:** Using sensors to predict the best driving actions.
   0. #### **Industry Use Cases:**
      Supervised learning is used extensively in industries like finance (fraud detection), marketing (customer segmentation and churn prediction), healthcare (disease prognosis), and technology (recommendation systems like those used by Netflix or Amazon).

1. <a name="1.6 machine learning workflow"></a>*Machine Learning Workflow*
   0. #### **Data Collection:**
      The process begins with gathering the appropriate data. For supervised learning, this data must include labeled examples (input-output pairs).
   0. #### **Data Preprocessing:**
      The data is cleaned and processed, often involving handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.
   0. #### **Model Selection:**
      The model type is chosen based on the problem at hand (e.g., linear regression for continuous output or logistic regression for binary classification).
   0. #### **Training:**
      The model is trained by adjusting its internal parameters (weights) to minimize the error between predictions and actual values. This is done using optimization algorithms like gradient descent.
   0. #### **Evaluation:**
      Once trained, the model’s performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error on a separate test dataset.
   0. #### **Tuning and Improvement:**
      Techniques such as cross-validation, regularization, or feature engineering are used to further improve the model's performance and robustness.

1. <a name="1.7 supervised vs. unsupervised learning"></a>*Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning*
   0. #### **Comparison:**
      In supervised learning, the key difference is that the model learns from labeled data (with known outputs). In contrast, unsupervised learning deals with finding patterns in unlabeled data. The course briefly touches on how unsupervised methods like clustering differ from supervised learning tasks like regression and classification.

1. # **Linear Regression With One Variable**
   1. <a name="2.1 model representation"></a>*Model Representation*
      0. #### **Linear Regression Model:**
         Linear regression models the relationship between a single feature (input variable) and the target (output variable) using a straight line (hence "linear"). The model attempts to find the best-fitting line to represent this relationship, which can be expressed mathematically as:

hₜₕₑₐ(x) = θ₀ + θ₁ ⋅ x

hθ(x)h\_\theta(x)hθ(x) is the hypothesis or predicted value for the input xxx. θ0\theta\_0θ0 is the intercept (the value of hθ(x)h\_\theta(x)hθ(x) when x=0x = 0x=0).

θ1\theta\_1θ1 is the slope, representing how much hθ(x)h\_\theta(x)hθ(x) changes with respect to xxx.

0. #### **Hypothesis Function:**
   The hypothesis function in linear regression represents the predicted value for a given input based on the parameters θ0\theta\_0θ0 and θ1\theta\_1θ1. It is essentially the line equation used to predict continuous outcomes.
0. #### **Visual Representation:**
   The course visually explains how the input-output relationship is plotted on a graph, with the line of best fit (hypothesis) trying to minimize the difference between predicted values and actual outputs.

1. <a name="2.2 cost function"></a>*Cost Function*

0. #### **Measuring Model Error:**
   To measure how well the linear regression model predicts outputs, we need to calculate the error between the predicted values and the actual values in the training set. The cost function quantifies this error.
0. #### **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**
   The cost function used for linear regression is called the Mean Squared Error (MSE), represented as:

   J(θ)=12m∑i=1m(hθ(x(i))−y(i))2J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum\_{i=1}^{m} \left( h\_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right)^2J(θ)=2m1i=1∑m(hθ(x(i))−y(i))2

   where:

   0. mmm is the number of training examples.
   0. hθ(x(i))h\_\theta(x^{(i)})hθ(x(i)) is the predicted value for the iii-th training example.
   0. y(i)y^{(i)}y(i) is the actual output for the iii-th training example.

The goal is to minimize this cost function, i.e., find the values of θ0\theta\_0θ0 and θ1\theta\_1θ1 that result in the lowest possible error between predicted and actual outputs.
0. #### **Importance of Minimizing the Cost Function:**
   Minimizing the cost function ensures that the model predicts outputs as accurately as possible for a given set of input values. This is essential for the model to generalize well to new, unseen data.

1. <a name="2.3 gradient descent"></a>*Gradient Descent*

0. #### **Optimization Method:**
   Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function by adjusting the model’s parameters (θ0\theta\_0θ0 and θ1\theta\_1θ1) in the direction that reduces the error. The algorithm works as follows:

0. Start with some initial values of θ0\theta\_0θ0 and θ1\theta\_1θ1.
0. Compute the cost function for these values.
0. Update θ0\theta\_0θ0 and θ1\theta\_1θ1 using the gradient of the cost function (i.e., the slope of the cost function with respect to these parameters).
0. Repeat until the cost function converges (i.e., no further significant reduction in error).
0. #### **Gradient Descent Formula:**
   The update rule for gradient descent is:

θj:=θj−α⋅1m∑i=1m(hθ(x(i))−y(i))xj(i)\theta\_j := \theta\_j - \alpha \cdot \frac{1}{m} \sum\_{i=1}^{m}

\left( h\_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right) x\_j^{(i)}θj:=θj−α⋅m1i=1∑m(hθ(x(i))−y(i))xj(i) where:

0. α\alphaα is the learning rate, controlling the step size for each update.
0. xj(i)x\_j^{(i)}xj(i) is the feature value for the iii-th training example (for j=0j=0j=0, x0x\_0x0 is always 1 to account for the intercept θ0\theta\_0θ0).
0. #### **Learning Rate and Convergence:**
   The learning rate α\alphaα is crucial for controlling how quickly or slowly gradient descent converges to the minimum of the cost function. If α\alphaα is too small, the convergence will be slow, and if it's too large, the algorithm might overshoot the minimum and fail to converge.
0. #### **Intuition Behind Gradient Descent:**
   The course provides visual explanations to show how the parameters θ0\theta\_0θ0 and θ1\theta\_1θ1 are updated iteratively, moving "downhill" on the cost function’s surface until the optimal values are reached.

1. <a name="2.4 applications of linear regression"></a>*Applications of Linear Regression*

0. #### **Real-World Example: Housing Prices**
   One common example is predicting housing prices based on the size of the house. The input feature is the size of the house (e.g., square footage), and the target output is the house price. The linear regression model learns from historical data to predict future house prices based on size.
0. #### **Other Applications:**
   Linear regression is widely used in fields like:

   0. **Finance:** Predicting stock prices based on historical trends.
   0. **Economics:** Modeling the relationship between income and expenditure.
   0. **Health:** Predicting a patient’s risk of disease based on measurable factors like age and lifestyle.
1. ## <a name="3. linear regression with multiple varia"></a>***Linear Regression with Multiple Variables***
In this section, you’ll expand the concept of linear regression to handle multiple input features, making the model more adaptable to complex datasets.

1. <a name="3.1 multiple features (multivariate line"></a>*Multiple Features (Multivariate Linear Regression)*

0. **Model Representation:** In multivariate linear regression, instead of a single input feature, the model predicts the output based on multiple features. The hypothesis function is extended to:

hθ(x)=θ0+θ1x1+θ2x2+⋯+θnxnh\_\theta(x) = \theta\_0 + \theta\_1 x\_1 + \theta\_2 x\_2 + \dots + \theta\_n x\_nhθ(x)=θ0+θ1x1+θ2x2+⋯+θnxn

where nnn is the number of input features (predictors). Here, θj\theta\_jθj represents the parameter (weight) for each feature xjx\_jxj.

0. **Vectorization:** To simplify the representation, linear algebra is used to express the hypothesis in vector form:

   hθ(x)=θT⋅xh\_\theta(x) = \theta^T \cdot xhθ(x)=θT⋅x

where θ\thetaθ and xxx are vectors, making computation more efficient, especially for large datasets.

1. <a name="3.2 gradient descent for multiple variab"></a>*Gradient Descent for Multiple Variables*

0. **Cost Function:** Similar to the single-variable case, the cost function for multiple variables is:

J(θ)=12m∑i=1m(hθ(x(i))−y(i))2J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum\_{i=1}^{m} \left( h\_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right)^2J(θ)=2m1i=1∑m(hθ(x(i))−y(i))2

It measures the error between predicted and actual outputs over the entire dataset.

0. **Gradient Descent Algorithm:** The update rule for gradient descent is extended to accommodate multiple features. For each parameter θj\theta\_jθj, the update rule becomes:

θj:=θj−α⋅1m∑i=1m(hθ(x(i))−y(i))xj(i)\theta\_j := \theta\_j - \alpha \cdot \frac{1}{m} \sum\_{i=1}^{m}

\left( h\_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right) x\_j^{(i)}θj:=θj−α⋅m1i=1∑m(hθ(x(i))−y(i))xj(i) This rule is applied iteratively for all features until the algorithm converges.

1. <a name="3.3 feature scaling and mean normalizati"></a>*Feature Scaling and Mean Normalization*

0. **Feature Scaling:** Feature scaling involves normalizing the range of input features to ensure they are on a similar scale. This prevents certain features from disproportionately influencing the model’s predictions.

   0. For example, rescaling features to a range of 0 to 1 or using standardization to adjust them to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
0. **Importance in Gradient Descent:** Feature scaling helps speed up gradient descent by ensuring that the model’s parameters update more uniformly, preventing slow convergence when features have drastically different ranges.
1. <a name="3.4 normal equation (closed-form solutio"></a>*Normal Equation (Closed-Form Solution)*

0. **An Alternative to Gradient Descent:** For linear regression, there is a closed-form solution to directly compute the optimal parameters using matrix algebra: θ=(XTX)−1XTy\theta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T yθ=(XTX)−1XTy This method avoids the need for iterative optimization but is computationally expensive for very large datasets. The normal equation is particularly useful for small datasets where inversion of the XTXX^T XXTX matrix is feasible.

1. ## <a name="4. polynomial regression"></a>***Polynomial Regression***
This module addresses cases where the relationship between the input and output is non-linear. Polynomial regression extends linear models by adding polynomial terms of the input features.

1. <a name="4.1 non-linear hypotheses"></a>*Non-Linear Hypotheses*

0. **Higher-Order Terms:** Polynomial regression introduces terms like x2,x3x^2, x^3x2,x3, etc., to the model:

   hθ(x)=θ0+θ1x+θ2x2+θ3x3+…h\_\theta(x) = \theta\_0 + \theta\_1 x + \theta\_2 x^2 + \theta\_3 x^3 +

   \dotshθ(x)=θ0+θ1x+θ2x2+θ3x3+…

   This allows the model to fit more complex, non-linear relationships in the data, while still using the machinery of linear regression.

0. **Model Complexity:** Adding higher-order terms increases the flexibility of the model, but it also increases the risk of overfitting, where the model fits noise in the data rather than the underlying relationship.

1. <a name="4.2 feature engineering:"></a>*Feature Engineering:*

0. **Creating Polynomial Features:** To implement polynomial regression, you create new features by raising existing features to various powers. These engineered features allow the model to capture non- linear trends.

1. <a name="4.3 overfitting and regularization:"></a>*Overfitting and Regularization:*

0. The course introduces regularization (later discussed in detail) as a method to prevent overfitting, which can become a problem when adding too many polynomial terms to the model.

<a name="vectorization with numpy"></a>***Vectorization with NumPy***

**Vectorization** refers to performing operations on entire arrays or datasets at once, rather than looping through elements individually. It greatly improves speed and efficiency, particularly in large datasets.

NumPy enables vectorized operations on arrays, making computations faster and more efficient. Instead of loops, operations like addition, multiplication, and matrix operations are applied to entire arrays simultaneously.

<a name="key examples:"></a>*Key Examples:*
1. #### **Element-wise Operations:**
   a = np.array([1, 2, 3])

   b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

   c = a + b # Output: [5, 7, 9]

1. Matrix Multiplication: np.dot(matrix1, matrix2)

1. ## <a name="5. classification and logistic regressio"></a>***Classification and Logistic Regression***
This section shifts from regression to classification problems, where the goal is to predict a discrete label, such as "spam" or "not spam."

1. <a name="5.1 binary classification:"></a>*Binary Classification:*

0. **Classification Problem:** In binary classification, the output is a label that takes one of two possible values (e.g., 0 or 1). Logistic regression is used to model the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class.

1. <a name="5.2 logistic function (sigmoid function)"></a>*Logistic Function (Sigmoid Function):*

0. **Sigmoid Curve:** The logistic regression model maps predicted values to probabilities using the sigmoid (logistic) function: hθ(x)=11+e−θTxh\_\theta(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\theta^T x}}hθ(x)=1+e−θTx1 This function produces outputs between 0 and 1, representing probabilities. If hθ(x)≥0.5h\_\theta(x) \geq

   0\.5hθ(x)≥0.5, the model predicts class 1, and if hθ(x)<0.5h\_\theta(x) < 0.5hθ(x)<0.5, it predicts class 0.

1. <a name="5.3 cost function for logistic regressio"></a>*Cost Function for Logistic Regression:*

0. **Log-Loss (Cross-Entropy Loss):** The cost function for logistic regression is different from linear regression. It is designed to handle classification: J(θ)=−1m∑i=1m[y(i)log⁡(hθ(x(i)))+(1−y(i))log⁡(1−hθ(x(i)))]J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m}

   \sum\_{i=1}^{m} \left[ y^{(i)} \log(h\_\theta(x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)}) \log(1 - h\_\theta(x^{(i)}))

   \right]J(θ)=−m1i=1∑m[y(i)log(hθ(x(i)))+(1−y(i))log(1−hθ(x(i)))] This cost function penalizes incorrect classifications more heavily, helping the model learn to make better predictions.

1. <a name="5.4 decision boundary:"></a>*Decision Boundary:*

0. **Classification Boundary:** The logistic regression model learns a decision boundary that separates the classes based on the input features. The decision boundary can be linear or non-linear, depending on the feature set.

1. ## <a name="6. advanced optimization"></a>***Advanced Optimization***
This module introduces more sophisticated optimization techniques to train models faster and more effectively than gradient descent alone.

1. <a name="6.1 gradient descent variants:"></a>*Gradient Descent Variants:*

0. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** Unlike batch gradient descent, which updates parameters using the entire dataset, SGD updates parameters for each training example, leading to faster updates. It’s particularly useful for large datasets.
0. **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent:** This method strikes a balance between batch gradient descent and SGD by updating parameters based on small batches of data, improving both convergence speed and stability.

1. <a name="6.2 conjugate gradient, bfgs, and l-bfgs"></a>*Conjugate Gradient, BFGS, and L-BFGS:*

0. **Advanced Optimization Algorithms:** These are more sophisticated algorithms that use second-order derivatives (Hessian matrix) to optimize the cost function more efficiently, particularly useful when gradient descent is slow to converge.


1. ## <a name="7. regularization"></a>***Regularization***
Regularization techniques are crucial to prevent overfitting, especially in models with a large number of features or highly flexible models like polynomial regression.

1. <a name="7.1 overfitting vs. underfitting:"></a>*Overfitting vs. Underfitting:*

0. **Overfitting:** Occurs when the model fits the noise in the training data, leading to poor generalization on new data.
0. **Underfitting:** Happens when the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
1. <a name="7.2 l2 regularization (ridge regression)"></a>*L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression):*

0. **Penalty on Large Weights:** Regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function based on the size of the model’s weights, discouraging the model from fitting too closely to the training data: J(θ)=12m∑i=1m(hθ(x(i))−y(i))2+λ2m∑j=1nθj2J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum\_{i=1}^{m} \left( h\_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right)^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum\_{j=1}^{n} \theta\_j^2J(θ)=2m1i=1∑m (hθ(x(i))−y(i))2+2mλj=1∑nθj2 The regularization parameter λ\lambdaλ controls the strength of this penalty.

1. <a name="7.3 regularized logistic regression:"></a>*Regularized Logistic Regression:*

0. **Regularization for Classification:** Regularization can also be applied to logistic regression models to prevent overfitting in classification tasks, particularly when the number of features is large relative to the number of examples.

1. ## <a name="8. evaluation of model performance"></a>***Evaluation of Model Performance***
In this section, you learn how to assess model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.

1. <a name="8.1 training vs. testing data:"></a>*Training vs. Testing Data:*

0. **Model Evaluation:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s ability to generalize to new data. The model is trained on the training set and tested on the testing set to assess its performance.

1. <a name="8.2 cross-validation:"></a>*Cross-Validation:*

0. **K-Fold Cross-Validation:** This technique splits the dataset into kkk subsets. The model is trained on k−1k-1k−1 subsets and validated on the remaining one, repeating this process kkk times. It provides a more robust estimate of model performance by reducing variability in training/test splits.

1. <a name="8.3 precision, recall, f1-score:"></a>*Precision, Recall, F1-Score:*

0. **Precision and Recall:** For classification tasks, especially with imbalanced datasets, accuracy isn’t always a good metric. Precision and recall are used to evaluate the model’s performance:

   0. **Precision:** Proportion of true positives among all positive predictions.
   0. **Recall:** Proportion of true positives among all actual positives.
0. **F1-Score:** The F1-Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric to evaluate performance in cases where there is a trade-off between the two.
