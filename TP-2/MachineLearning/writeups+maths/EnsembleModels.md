## Introduction

Ensemble methods improve the predictive performance of machine learning models by aggregating the outputs of several base models. The main idea is to reduce bias, variance, or both, depending on the ensemble technique used.

---

## Types of Ensemble Methods

### Bagging

Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) reduces variance by training multiple models on different subsets of the training data and averaging their predictions (for regression) or using majority voting (for classification).

### Boosting

Boosting sequentially trains models, with each model focusing on correcting the errors of its predecessor. This reduces bias and variance, leading to more accurate predictions.

### Stacking

Stacking combines predictions from multiple models (level-0 models) using another model (level-1 model) to make the final prediction. It leverages the strengths of different types of models.

## Mathematics of Ensemble Methods

### Mathematics of Bagging

Bagging generates multiple training datasets using bootstrap sampling and trains a base model (e.g., decision tree) on each dataset. The final prediction is an aggregate of the individual models:

For regression:
$$
\hat{y} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \hat{y}^{(m)}
$$

For classification (majority voting):
$$
\hat{y} = \text{mode}\{\hat{y}^{(1)}, \hat{y}^{(2)}, \dots, \hat{y}^{(M)}\}
$$

Where:
- $M$: Number of models.
- $\hat{y}^{(m)}$: Prediction from the $m$-th model.

### Mathematics of Boosting

Boosting combines weak learners iteratively, with each model correcting the errors of the previous one. The final prediction is a weighted sum of the predictions from all models:

$$
\hat{y} = \sum_{m=1}^M \alpha_m \cdot \hat{y}^{(m)}
$$

Where:
- $\alpha_m$: Weight assigned to the $m$-th model, typically based on its performance.
- $\hat{y}^{(m)}$: Prediction from the $m$-th model.

#### AdaBoost Example

1. Initialize sample weights: $w_i = \frac{1}{n}$ for all $i$.
2. For each model $m$:
   - Train the model and calculate the weighted error:
     $$
     \text{Error}_m = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i \cdot \mathbb{I}(y_i \neq \hat{y}_i^{(m)})}{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i}
     $$
   - Compute the model weight:
     $$
     \alpha_m = \log\left(\frac{1 - \text{Error}_m}{\text{Error}_m}\right)
     $$
   - Update sample weights:
     $$
     w_i \leftarrow w_i \cdot e^{\alpha_m \cdot \mathbb{I}(y_i \neq \hat{y}_i^{(m)})}
     $$
     Normalize $w_i$.
3. Output the final prediction as:
   $$
   \hat{y} = \text{sign}\left(\sum_{m=1}^M \alpha_m \cdot \hat{y}_i^{(m)}\right)
   $$

### Mathematics of Stacking

Stacking combines the predictions of multiple base models (level-0) using a meta-model (level-1). Let $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_M$ be the base models and $H$ be the meta-model:

1. Train each base model $h_m$ on the training dataset to produce predictions $\hat{y}_m$.
2. Use the predictions from all base models as input features to train the meta-model $H$:
   $$
   H(\mathbf{X}) = \hat{y} = g(\hat{y}_1, \hat{y}_2, \dots, \hat{y}_M)
   $$

Where $g$ is the function learned by the meta-model.
