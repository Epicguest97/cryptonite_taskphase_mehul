# Linear Regression: A Comprehensive Overview

Linear regression is one of the most fundamental and widely used algorithms in machine learning and statistics. It is a simple yet powerful technique for predicting a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables.

## Introduction

Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) by fitting a linear equation to observed data. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables.

## Types of Linear Regression

### Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression involves a single independent variable $x$ and models the relationship as:

$$
\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x
$$

Where:
- $\hat{y}$: Predicted value of the dependent variable.
- $\beta_0$: Intercept (value of $y$ when $x = 0$).
- $\beta_1$: Slope of the line (rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$).
- $x$: Independent variable.

### Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression extends the simple linear regression model to multiple independent variables:

$$
\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_p x_p
$$

Where:
- $p$: Number of independent variables.
- $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_p$: Independent variables.
- $\beta_1, \beta_2, \dots, \beta_p$: Coefficients corresponding to each independent variable.

## Mathematics of Linear Regression

### Model Equation

The general form of a linear regression model can be expressed in matrix notation as:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X} \boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}
$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{y}$: Vector of observed values (size $n \times 1$).
- $\mathbf{X}$: Design matrix of input features (size $n \times (p+1)$), where the first column is all ones (for the intercept).
- $\boldsymbol{\beta}$: Vector of coefficients (size $(p+1) \times 1$).
- $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$: Vector of errors (residuals).

### Cost Function

The cost function measures the error between the predicted values and the actual values. For linear regression, the cost function is the Mean Squared Error (MSE):

$$
J(\boldsymbol{\beta}) = \frac{1}{2n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2
$$

In matrix form:

$$
J(\boldsymbol{\beta}) = \frac{1}{2n} (\mathbf{X} \boldsymbol{\beta} - \mathbf{y})^T (\mathbf{X} \boldsymbol{\beta} - \mathbf{y})
$$

Where:
- $\hat{y}_i$: Predicted value for observation $i$.
- $y_i$: Actual value for observation $i$.

### Gradient Descent Optimization

Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function:

1. **Update Rule:**
   $$
   \boldsymbol{\beta} \leftarrow \boldsymbol{\beta} - \alpha \nabla J(\boldsymbol{\beta})
   $$

   Where:
   - $\alpha$: Learning rate.
   - $\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\beta})$: Gradient of the cost function.

2. **Gradient of Cost Function:**
   $$
   \nabla J(\boldsymbol{\beta}) = \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{X}^T (\mathbf{X} \boldsymbol{\beta} - \mathbf{y})
   $$

### Normal Equation

An analytical solution to linear regression can be obtained using the Normal Equation:

$$
\boldsymbol{\beta} = (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1} \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{y}
$$

This avoids iterative optimization but requires inversion of $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}$, which can be computationally expensive for large datasets.

## Assumptions of Linear Regression

1. **Linearity:** The relationship between independent and dependent variables is linear.
2. **Independence:** Observations are independent of each other.
3. **Homoscedasticity:** Constant variance of residuals.
4. **Normality:** Residuals are normally distributed.
5. **No Multicollinearity:** Independent variables are not highly correlated.

- **Risk Assessment:** Credit scoring, insurance premium calculations.
- **Scientific Research:** Modeling relationships in experimental data.
