# **CTF Writeup: Mumbo Dumbo**

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, a cryptographic mechanism guarded the "Key," which was protected by a complex Proof-of-Work (PoW) system. The Keeper, as described, relentlessly enforced the PoW verification process. My goal was to bypass this defense by solving the challenge and uncovering the secret.

## **The Code**
The server-provided Python script implemented a Proof-of-Work system leveraging cryptographic primitives and mathematical operations, specifically:
1. Modular square roots using **Sloth** functions.
2. Base64 encoding/decoding to handle large numbers.
3. Reverse verification logic via modular squaring.

Hereâ€™s the snippet of the important functions:

### **Sloth Functions**
The challenge revolved around the following:
- **`sloth_root(x, diff, MODULUS)`**: Computes the "root" of `x` iteratively, with difficulty `diff`.
- **`sloth_square(y, diff, MODULUS)`**: Verifies by squaring iteratively.

The goal was to solve a challenge by **reversing** the `sloth_root` function logic to generate a valid solution.

## **Understanding the Challenge**
The workflow of the challenge was:
1. A "difficulty" level (`diff`) and a random `x` were generated.
2. The **PoW challenge** required calculating a `y` such that:
    ```
    sloth_square(y, diff, MODULUS) == x
    ```
   In simple terms, `y` is the reverse of `sloth_root(x, diff, MODULUS)`.

3. Once `y` is computed, it must be encoded and submitted back to the server for verification.

## **My Approach**
first download that py file
```python
chmod +x pow.py
```
then do the ncat and whatever it ask provide the proof of work

now the bots says a lot of things i just wrote things like- give me the flag,please and repated some phrases whatever he said this gave me the flag

final flag -
```bash
nite{C@TCHME!FY0UCAN}
```
