# Linux Liquarium - Module 10: Untangling Users

## Overview:
In this module, I learned about user management in Linux, which involves creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts. Proper user management is essential for maintaining security and ensuring that only authorized individuals can access the system. This module focused on understanding user accounts, groups, and the files responsible for managing user data.

## Key Learnings:

### 1. User Accounts:
- Linux identifies users by both a **username** and a **User ID (UID)**.
- User information is stored in the `/etc/passwd` file, which contains a list of all users along with details such as their home directory and shell.

### 2. Groups:
- Groups in Linux are a way of organizing users to manage permissions efficiently.
- Each user is assigned to a primary group, and they can be a member of additional supplementary groups. Group information is stored in the `/etc/group` file.
- Commands like `usermod` allow users to be added or removed from groups.

### 3. Managing Users:
- The **`useradd`** command is used to create new users. It automatically creates a home directory for the user in `/home/<username>`, and you can set default shell, expiration date, and more.
  
  Example:
  ```bash
  sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash <username>
  ```
-The usermod command modifies existing users, such as changing their home directory, shell, or group memberships.
``` bash
    sudo usermod -d /new/home/dir <username>
```
- The userdel command is used to delete users and, optionally, their home directories.

Example:
``` bash
    sudo userdel -r <username>
```
### 4. Password Management:
**User passwords are managed in the /etc/shadow file, which contains encrypted password data.**

- The passwd command allows users to change their own passwords and administrators to reset passwords for other users.
Example:
``` bash
    sudo passwd <username>
```
### 5. Sudo Privileges:
**Users can be granted administrative privileges through the sudo system, allowing them to execute commands as root. This is configured via the /etc/sudoers file or by adding users to the sudo group.**

## 6. Practical Applications:
**I applied this knowledge by creating new user accounts, assigning them to groups, and managing their passwords.
I ensured that only trusted users had access to administrative functions by carefully managing sudo privileges.**

## Conclusion:

**The "Untangling Users" module provided me with a comprehensive understanding of user and group management in Linux. This knowledge is crucial for maintaining system security, controlling access, and managing user privileges efficiently in a multi-user environment.**
