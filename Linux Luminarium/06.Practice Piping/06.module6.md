# Module 6: Practicing Piping

**Overview:**  
This module focuses on using pipes (`|`) in Linux to combine multiple commands, where the output of one command becomes the input for another. Piping is an essential tool for creating efficient workflows in Linux.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Basic Piping with `cat` and `grep`
**Key Learnings:**
- Pipes (`|`) allow the output of one command to be used as the input of another.
- Example: Use `cat` to display a file and `grep` to filter lines containing a keyword:
  ```bash
  cat file.txt | grep "keyword"
  ```

### Challenge 2: Chaining Multiple Commands ###
**Key Learnings:**
- Multiple commands can be chained using pipes.
- Example: Using ls, grep, and wc to count the number of .txt files:
  ```bash 
        ls | grep ".txt" | wc -l
  ```  

### Challenge 3: Redirecting Output with > and >> ###
**Key Learnings:**
- Use > to overwrite and >> to append output to a file.
- Example: Redirecting output of ls to a file:
``` bash 
    ls > output.txt
```
### Challenge 4: Combining sort and uniq ###
**Key Learnings:**
- Combine sort and uniq to filter out duplicate lines from a file.
- Example: Sort and remove duplicates:
``` bash
    cat file.txt | sort | uniq
```
### Challenge 5: Using xargs for Advanced Piping ###
**Key Learnings:**
- xargs allows arguments to be passed from the output of one command to another.
- Example: Deleting files listed in a text file:
``` bash
    cat files_to_delete.txt | xargs rm
```
### Challenge 6: Piping with find and grep ###
**Key Learnings:**
- Combine find and grep to search through file contents.
- Example: Find files containing a specific pattern:
``` bash
    find . -name "*.txt" | xargs grep "pattern"
```
### Conclusion ###
- This module teaches the powerful concept of piping, allowing for efficient command combinations. Piping is key to simplifying complex workflows in Linux.
