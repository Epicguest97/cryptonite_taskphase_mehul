# Module 5: File Globbing

**Overview:**  
This module focuses on understanding and using file globbing techniques in Linux, which allow users to select files using wildcard characters like `*`, `?`, and `[]`. File globbing simplifies file management tasks by enabling pattern matching.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Understanding the Asterisk (`*`)
**Key Learnings:**
- The `*` wildcard matches zero or more characters in a filename.
- It can be used to select multiple files with common patterns.
- Example: To list all `.txt` files in a directory:
  ```bash
  ls *.txt
  ```

### Challenge 2: Using the Question Mark (`?`)
**Key Learnings:**
- The `?` wildcard matches exactly one character in a filename.
- It's useful for selecting files with variable single characters.
- Example: To list all `.log` files with names like `file1.log`, `file2.log`, etc.:
  ```bash
  ls file?.log
  ```

### Challenge 3: Square Brackets (`[]`) for Character Ranges
**Key Learnings:**
- Square brackets `[ ]` allow specifying a range or set of characters to match.
- You can match any one character from the specified set.
- Example: To list files with names `file1`, `file2`, or `file3`:
  ```bash
  ls file[123].txt
  ```

### Challenge 4: Using the Hyphen for Character Ranges
**Key Learnings:**
- Hyphen `-` inside square brackets denotes a range of characters.
- Useful for matching a sequence of numbers or letters.
- Example: To list files named `file1.txt` to `file9.txt`:
  ```bash
  ls file[1-9].txt
  ```

### Challenge 5: Combining Wildcards
**Key Learnings:**
- Wildcards can be combined to form more complex patterns.
- Example: To list all `.txt` files that have names starting with "doc" and containing a number:
  ```bash
  ls doc[0-9]*.txt
  ```

### Challenge 6: Negating a Set
**Key Learnings:**
- Use `!` inside square brackets to negate the set and match any character not in the specified range.
- Example: To list all files except those starting with `a` or `b`:
  ```bash
  ls [!ab]*.txt
  ```

## Conclusion
This module highlights the power of file globbing in Linux, enabling users to efficiently manage large sets of files by using patterns instead of manually specifying filenames. Mastery of file globbing techniques is essential for automating tasks and working with complex directory structures.
