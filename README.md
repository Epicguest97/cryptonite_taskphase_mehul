## Linux Lumanirium

- **Modules Completed:**
  - I completed all 12 modules from [pwn.college](https://pwn.college), focusing on Linux exploitation and system-level programming.
  - Topics covered include:
    - Binary Exploitation
    - Reverse Engineering
    - Shellcoding
    - Networking and Scripting

## Write-ups for NiteCTF Challenges

### Solved Challenges:

1. **RSAabc (Crypto)**
   - Cracked a cipher using a blend of encryption methods.
   - Learned about vulnerabilities in RSA encryption and mathematical approaches to exploit them.

2. **Glitch, Please! (AI)**
   - Analyzed player profile pictures to solve a CTF challenge.
   - Identified patterns in image datasets to uncover cheating players, leading to the flag.
   - Used filtering methods to extract pixel data (e.g., 65536-sized pixel arrays) and interpret encoded information.

### Unsolved Challenge:

- **Firewall Farewell (AI)**
  - Explored the challenge but could not arrive at a solution.
  - Gained insights into AI-based firewall mechanisms and anomaly detection.

## AI Challenges

### Solved:

1. **Mumbo Dumbo (AI)**
   - Task involved analyzing machine learning predictions and decision boundaries.
   - Implemented troubleshooting techniques for model accuracy issues.

2. **Glitch, Please! (AI)**
   - Detailed above under "NiteCTF Challenges."

## Task Phase 2 (TP-2)

### Learnings in Research AI:

- Gained hands-on experience with core libraries for data analysis and AI:
  1. **Pandas**
  2. **NumPy**

- Implemented machine learning models from scratch to understand their mathematical principles:

1. **Linear Regression**
   - Derived and implemented gradient descent.
   - Calculated loss functions manually.

2. **Logistic Regression**
   - Focused on classification problems.
   - Learned about sigmoid functions and decision thresholds.

3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
   - Implemented the dual form of SVM.
   - Understood the concept of margins and kernel trick.

4. **Random Forest**
   - Built an ensemble of decision trees.
   - Explored bagging techniques and feature importance.

5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - Implemented a distance-based classifier.
   - Learned the impact of different distance metrics.

6. **Ensemble Models**
   - Explored boosting and bagging methods.
   - Implemented AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting manually.

### Key Takeaways:

- Developed a deeper understanding of mathematical underpinnings of ML algorithms.
- Enhanced debugging and troubleshooting skills by building models without high-level libraries like scikit-learn.
